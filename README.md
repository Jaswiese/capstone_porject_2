# Basic Delivery driver management Capstone project 2 (hyperionDev)
## Summary:
This is a project assigned by my HyperionDev course, in which I was asked to develop a program that can take "orders" from a user and assigned these orders to the appropriate delivery drivers in the local geographic area from which the order was received.

This program uses .txt files as storage, to keep track of the drivers and their individual load. When an order has been successfully placed it is assigned to the driver with the lowest load in the geographic pool. (Their load is also dynamically updated).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Git â€“ installed on your computer. 
  * Github account 
  * CLI 

  #### Steps

  **Navigate to the directory of your choice using CLI.** 
  
  ```
  cd chosen-directory
  
  ```
  **Using git commands in your CLI initialise the directory as a git repository.**
  
  ```
  git init
  
  ```
  
  **Clone the repository using the repository URL*** 
  
  ```
  git clone []
  
  ```
  
  You will now have the files in your chosen directory if you have followed the steps above/ and have access to the repository.
  

## Usage

The user will be prompted in the console of your chosen IDE on program execute to enter the relevant data. 

The program will create individual invoices with each order and name them according to the order number submitted by the user

After each order the load of the drivers will be updated in the drivers.txt file

## Contributing

Currently no pull /and or clone requests are welcome, as this project is primarily used for assessment for my HyperionDev course.
